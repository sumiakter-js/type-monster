      <h3><strong>Variable Scope: Global vs. Local</strong></h3>
      <p><strong>Global Scope:</strong></p>
      <p>Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structure that create a code block. A global variable has
         global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</p>
      <p><strong>Local Scope:</strong></p>
      <p>
        Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. 
        A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.
      </p>

      <h2><strong>Event Listener</strong></h2>
      <p>
        An event listener is a function that initiates a predefined process if a specific event occurs. So, an event listener “listens” for an action, then calls a function that performs a related task. This event can take one of many forms. 
        Common examples include mouse events, keyboard events, and window events.
      </p>
      <p>You can listen for events on any element in the DOM. JavaScript has an addEventListener() function that you can call on any element on a web page. The addEventListener() function is a method of the EventTarget interface. All objects that support events implement this interface. 
        This includes the window, the document, and individual elements on the page.</p>
